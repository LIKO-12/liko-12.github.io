Most likely this blog post will stay empty for some time being, but I'll leave it here in the hope of it being used for:

- Posts about new releases.
- Posts about upcoming updates.
- Current development progress.
- Some guide possibly written by anyone as a tutorial.
- Technical post about something in LIKO-12 or made using LIKO-12.

If you're interested in writing a post please don't hesitate to ask on LIKO-12's Discord!
